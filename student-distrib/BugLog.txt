CHECKPOINT 1:
*************

BUG 1:
Description:	We attempted to use a macro to declare the basic exception handlers
				we are using.
Fix:			Instead of using a macro, we wrote all of the fuctions by hand in 
				the header file.

BUG 2:
Description:	The RTC was not intializing while the keyboard was initialized.
				Both of them would work individually, but attempting to intialize
				both of them at the same time would result in the RTC producing
				no interupts
Fix:			We put a while loop at the end of both interupt handlers as a
				replacment for an assembly wrapper. In the future we will write
				a wrapper to properly handle this problem, but for now this allows
				us to run the code and test other aspects of our OS.
